## Architecture

BookMonkey is a standalone Angular application organized around a books feature, with component-local state and a dedicated HTTP API client. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the project structure, routing, data flow, styling, testing setup, and guidance for new developers.

## Local Development

| Command       | Description                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install` | Installs the packages to develop the Angular app |
| `npm start`   | Starts the Angular app                           |

## Validation

Run `npm run build` for a production build. Install browser binaries once with `npx playwright install`, then run `npm test` (or `npm run test:e2e`) for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Use `npm test -- --project=chromium` for a focused run. Tests start a dedicated frontend on port 4202 and mock the API; the backend does not need to run. No unit-test runner is configured.

On PowerShell, use `npm.cmd` / `npx.cmd` if execution policy blocks the script wrappers.

To test the production API configuration on port 4201 in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:BOOKMONKEY_TEST_PRODUCTION = '1'
try { npm.cmd test -- --project=chromium } finally { Remove-Item Env:BOOKMONKEY_TEST_PRODUCTION }
```

## Issue analysis automation

The [issue-analysis workflow](.github/workflows/issue-analysis.yml) analyzes new or edited issues and human issue comments. It runs `clarify-feature` with Codex, which reads the issue context, adds suitable existing repository labels while preserving current labels, and posts clarification questions or the requirements story directly as a comment. It reuses matching labels and creates missing reusable labels with descriptions and colors when needed; it does not remove labels. Bot comments and pull-request comments are excluded. The workflow must be on the default branch and currently reads its OpenAI API key from the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret; despite that name, the value must be an OpenAI API key. It creates a dedicated Codex home under the runner's temporary directory with a `github-issues` permission profile extending `:workspace` and allowing network access to `api.github.com`. GitHub CLI uses the built-in GitHub token through `GH_TOKEN` with `issues: write`; a personal access token is not required.

## API configuration and deployment

Development uses `http://localhost:4730` from [environment.development.ts](src/environments/environment.development.ts). Production uses same-origin `/api` from [environment.ts](src/environments/environment.ts), supplied through the `BOOK_API_BASE_URL` injection token. Configure the production base URL before building, or provide a reverse proxy that maps `/api/books` to the backend's `/books` and strips the `/api` prefix. This repository does not implement that proxy. Cross-origin deployments require backend CORS configuration.

## The API

| Command              | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `npx bookmonkey-api` | Installs and starts the HTTP API "Bookmonkey API" |

The API provides fake data that you can use in your Angular application.

> [!NOTE]
> The API starts at http://localhost:4730.
> When you open this page, you’ll find documentation for all endpoints. 🚀

## VS Code

If you are using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as you editor of choice, you might see a popup after opening this repository.
We added a few plugin recommendations to simplify writing code during the workshop:

1. Angular Language Service - Adds better syntax-highlighting & automatic refactorings
1. Prettier - Formats your code automatically in the same way across your project.
